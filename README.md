# Getting_CleaningDataCourseProject
This is a project for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data

## There are five files in this repo:
- README.md: describe the goal of this repo and how the R script work
- Code_Book.md: describes the variables, the data, and the transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
- run_analysis.R: the script does the following
  - 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 Â ### Note: to successfully run the R script, you need to first download and unzip the datasets
- task4_finaldata.txt: the tidy data for the first 4 steps
- task5_tidydata.txt: a second tidy data for task 5
